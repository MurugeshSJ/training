	<p>One particular book which is recommended reading is <u>The Street Lawyer</u> by <u>John Grisham</u>. This book is
about a lawyer who begins re-evaluating his priorities in life when a bad incident occurs within his law
firm. Consequently, he becomes acquainted with the inner city streets, and realizes the harsh existence
of the homeless, and vows to give them a chance in the courts. <u>The Street Lawyer</u> is a <b>great</b> book. It is
<b>well written</b> and <b>interesting</b>. Other books by <u>John Grisham</u> include <u>The Firm</u>, <u>The Pelican Brief</u>, and <u>The
Client</u>.</p>
